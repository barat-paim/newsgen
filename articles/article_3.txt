The article argues that culture is dying and being replaced by a system of ever-changing cultural codes.

The author, Joshua Rothman, uses his own experience as a child of immigrants to illustrate this point. He grew up in a household where Malaysian culture was central, but as he got older, he realized that this culture wasn't shared by the people around him.

Rothman then discusses the work of French political scientist Olivier Roy, who argues that globalization, neoliberalism, and other forces are undermining culture by making it "transparent" and turning cultural practices into "a collection of tokens" to be displayed. Roy believes that this is leading to a "crisis of culture."

Rothman acknowledges that some people might find Roy's ideas out of touch, but he says that they have caused him to look more carefully at how he lives. He concludes by arguing that while the loss of culture is a loss, there are other ways of experiencing commonality.
